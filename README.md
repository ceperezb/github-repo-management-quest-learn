# AI-Powered Content Repository Management Quest

## Quest Overview

Welcome to the **GitHub Repository Management Quest** - an interactive learning experience designed for content developers who want to master AI-assisted repository management workflows. This quest simulates real-world scenarios that content teams face daily, from taking over unfamiliar repositories to managing complex pull requests and issue backlogs.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this quest, you will:

1. **Master AI-assisted repository exploration** - Learn to quickly understand unfamiliar codebases and documentation structures using AI tools
2. **Develop advanced PR review skills** - Process complex pull requests with multiple markdown file changes, style inconsistencies, and technical accuracy issues
3. **Implement efficient issue management** - Triage, categorize, and respond to large backlogs of issues using AI-powered analysis
4. **Create documentation standards** - Establish and maintain content quality through automated checks and AI-assisted reviews
5. **Build practical workflows** - Develop repeatable processes for common content repository management tasks

## Quest Structure

This quest contains three progressive scenarios, each building on skills from the previous one:

### Scenario 1: The Inheritance
**Duration:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner to Intermediate

You've just been assigned to take over a documentation repository from a team member who left suddenly. The repository contains dozens of markdown files, some Python utilities, and no clear structure. Your mission: understand what you've inherited, identify issues, and create an actionable improvement plan.

**Tasks:**
- 1.1: Explore and map the repository structure using AI
- 1.2: Identify outdated content, broken links, and inconsistencies
- 1.3: Generate a comprehensive content audit report
- 1.4: Create or update documentation standards

### Scenario 2: The Big Merge
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

A contributor has submitted a massive pull request touching 15+ markdown files across multiple documentation sections. The changes include new tutorials, updated guides, and restructured content. You need to review this PR efficiently, identify issues, and guide the contributor to success.

**Tasks:**
- 2.1: Perform a comprehensive AI-assisted PR review
- 2.2: Identify style inconsistencies and technical accuracy issues
- 2.3: Provide constructive feedback and suggestions
- 2.4: Validate cross-references and related documentation updates

### Scenario 3: The Backlog Battle
**Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced

Your documentation repository has accumulated 25+ open issues over the past few months. They range from typo fixes to requests for new content, from bug reports to feature suggestions. Your challenge: triage this backlog efficiently and create a sustainable issue management process.

**Tasks:**
- 3.1: Categorize and prioritize the issue backlog using AI
- 3.2: Identify duplicates, related issues, and dependencies
- 3.3: Create issue templates for common request types
- 3.4: Draft responses and close/update issues appropriately

## Prerequisites

- **Git fundamentals**: Basic understanding of repositories, commits, branches, and pull requests
- **Markdown knowledge**: Familiarity with markdown syntax and documentation
- **AI tool access**: Access to an AI coding assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
- **Tools**: Git client, text editor or IDE, command line access

**Optional but helpful:**
- Experience with documentation systems (MkDocs, Jekyll, Docusaurus)
- Basic Python knowledge for understanding utility scripts
- Prior experience with code review processes

## Quest Format

This quest uses a **conceptual and interactive lab** format:

- **Conceptual sections** explain key concepts, best practices, and AI-assisted workflows
- **Interactive labs** provide hands-on exercises with real repository scenarios
- **Solution guides** offer multiple approaches to each challenge
- **Reflection prompts** encourage you to think about applying these skills to your work

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine
2. **Start with Scenario 1** in the `scenario-1-inheritance/` directory
3. **Read the scenario overview** and review the challenge repository
4. **Complete each task** following the instructions in the task files
5. **Check your work** against the solution guides when you're ready
6. **Progress through scenarios** at your own pace
